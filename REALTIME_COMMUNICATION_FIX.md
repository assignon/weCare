# Real-Time Communication Fix - Shopper & Pharmacy

## Issue Summary
The real-time communication between shopper and pharmacy/seller when a medicine request was sent had several issues:
- Shoppers couldn't see seller details when pharmacies received their requests

  - Stores requestId for later use

- **`updateSellerStatus()` function** - Enhanced status tracking and notifications
